Likes on FB Post have been a subject of attraction amongst users. The users wanna know who all have liked, loved, wowed their post. These emotions added apart from like-button makes your post super interactive in nature.

We have built Regression Models, Checked Assumptions & kept a tab on Overfitting/Underfitting too apart from having fun in finding the patterns.
